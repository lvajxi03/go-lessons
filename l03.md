# Variables, types, conversions, basic keywords, structures and pointers


## Variables

`var` -- declares list of variables.

The type is last.

`var` statement can be a package or function level.

```go
var x, y, z int
```

## Initializers

```go
var i,j int = 1, 2
```

Type can be omitted -- type of initializer will be used:

```go
var i,j = 1, 2
```

Short assignment

`:=` constrution is used for short assignment

```go
k := 3 // with no implicit type
```

## Basic types

* bool
* string
* int, int8, int16, int32, int64
* uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64
* byte // uint8
* rune // int32
* float: float32, float64
* complex: complex32, complex64

## Complex type

Complex numbers are included into core language specs.

Initialization:
```go
c1 := complex(4, 5) // real and imaginary part
```

or

```go
c2 := 10 + 11i
```

Available operations:

`+ - * / ==`

Obtainint real or imaginary parts:

```go
r1 = real(c1)
i1 = imag(c1)
```

## Zero

* `0` for numeric
* `false` for bool
* "" for string

No initial value for a variable gives it a zero value.

## Type conversions

* `T(v)` converts value `v` to type `T`

Assignments of items with different types require explicit conversion.

## const

Constants can be character, string, boolean or numeric values.

`:=` cannot be used

```go
const pi = 3.14
```

## for

```go
for initial; conditional; post {
    statement
}
```

initial -> `:=` statement

Braces always required!

Initial and post statements are optional.

No `while` loop, `for` with condition only does the job

forever loop:

```go
for {
}
```

## if

```go
if condition {
    statement
}

Braces always required!

Parentheses optional.

```go
if short statement; condition {
    statement
}
```

Example:

```go
if k := 3; k < 5 {
    // something
}
```

Variables declared in `if :=` statement are available also in `else` block.

## switch

No break statement needed.

`:=` short statement available.

Switch cases cannot be constants. Values need to be integers.

`default` block available.

`switch` with no condition -- `true` in use.

```go
switch {
    case f < 12:
        ....
    case x > 30:
        ....
}
```

## defer

wait until surrounding function completes.

```go
func main() {
    defer fmt.Println("world !")
    fmt.Println("Hello,")
}
```

Stacking defers also available.

Deferred calls use LIFO order in execution

## Pointers

`*T` -- pointer to `T` type.

Its zero value is `nil`.

```go
var p *int
i := 42
p = &i
*p = 21
```

`go` has no pointer arithmetic.

## struct

Collection of fields.

```go
type mytype struct {
    X int
    Y int
}

`struct` fields are accesed with a dot.

```go
v := mytype{2, 3}
p := &v
p.X = 3 // <- no dereferencing needed
```

## struct literals

Listing values of fields.

Subset of fields can be listed by `Name:` syntax:


```go
type V struct {
    X, Y int
}

var (
    v  V{X: 1}
    w  V(Y: 3}
)

Prefix `&` returns pointer to regular var.
