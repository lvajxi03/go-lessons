# Enum

There is no special keyword nor construction in `Go` that creates a special type for `enums`. `Go` prefers `consts`, however, you can organize all of them in groups of related values.

# const

Constant declarations can be organize in a group, just like the imports, etc:

```go
const (
    A = 1
    B = 3
    C = 7
    D = 19
)
```

This construction does not make it special in any way, just the smart group of values. And that's why `iota` was introduced.

# iota

As per official specs:

`iota` represents successive untyped integer constants. Its value is the index of respective const spec in that constant declaration, starting at zero. It can be used to construct a set of related constants.

Example:

```go
const (
    A = iota
    B = iota
    C = iota
    D = iota
)
```

So far, so good: `A = 0`, `B = 1`, `C = 2` and `D = 3`.

Consider this example:

```go
const (
    A = iota
    B = iota
    C = iota
    D = iota
)

const (
    E = iota
    F = iota
    G = iota
)

```

`iota` **gets reset** in the second block, so `E = 0`, `F = 1`, etc.

As the `iota` is integer, you can introduce some fancy expressions, if needed:

```go
const (
    A = iota        // A = 0
    B = iota + 3    // B = 1 + 3
    C = iota * 10   // C = 2 * 10
)
```

If you need to name a type, you can also use it in your set of consts:

```go
type MyType int64

const (
    A MyType = iota
    B
    C
    D
    )
```
