# Methods

## Overview

`Go` does not have classes. Types can have methods.

A `method` is a function with special `receiver` argument.

Receiver appears in its own arguments list between `func` keyword and its name.

```go
type V struct {
    X, Y float64
}

func (v V) wtf() float64 {
    return v.X + v.Y
}

func main() {
    v := V{X: 1, Y: 2}
	fmt.Println(v.wtf()) // syntactic sugar here!
}
```

## Pointer receivers

Receiver type has literal syntax `*T` for some type `T`.`

These methods are allowed to modify receivers (as pointer parameters in `C`) -- otherwise a copy is modified (and used locally, then destroyed at the end of the scope)

```go
func(v *V) wtf() float64 {
    v.X += 2
	v.Y += 2
	return v.X + v.Y
}

func main() {
    v := V{X: 1, Y: 2}
	fmt.Println(v.wtf())
	fmt.Println(v.wtf())
}
```

Pointers are referenced/dereferenced on demand.

## Null pointers

Null (`nil`) pointer receiver that calls a method, generates `SIGSEGV`.
